# Shortly - A Modern URL Shortener Frontend

This is the frontend for the Shortly URL shortener application, built with React and Vite. It provides a clean, fast, and responsive user interface for creating and managing short links.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionality.
- **URL Shortening**: Quickly shorten long URLs with a single click.
- **Link Management**: View, copy, and delete your shortened URLs from a personal dashboard.
- **Responsive Design**: A seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Built with a professional design system, including a specific color palette and custom animations.

## Running the Frontend

1.  **Navigate to the `Frontend` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

**Note:** Ensure the backend server is running, as this frontend makes API calls to it (expected at `http://localhost:8000`).
